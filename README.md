# Description
This repo is a series of different scenarios and situations that will aide me in learning various CSS and Javascript concepts. 

## Pages
- Page 01: Event Bubbling
    - I created a small animation and attempted to toggle a class that would hide and display some divs
    - The divs could be hidden by clicking on the container div or body of the document, however this would not occur
    - The act of clicking on the divs would seemingly bubble up to the parent container 
    - This page is my investigation into this behavior
